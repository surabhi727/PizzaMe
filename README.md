# PizzaMe 
## Features:
App displays a list of pizza places near the device location with distance.
User can select one of the places to see the details. This page allows user to see selected place on the map, call and visit website. 

## About code:
The project contains 2 activities one for List of pizza places (MainActivity) and one for details (PlaceDetailsActivity).
I have used ModelViews to populate the data on both pages. 
Retrofit is used for fetching the data from yahoo apis.
Robolectric tests are written for the models views.
